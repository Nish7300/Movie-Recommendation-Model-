1. Getting the Tools Ready:

The code first brings in two helpful tools, like a carpenter gathering a hammer and saw. These tools are called numpy and pandas, and they're great for working with numbers and data tables.
2. Bringing in the Data:

The code then fetches two lists of movie information from files named tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv. Think of these like two notebooks filled with movie details.
3. Combining the Lists:

It merges these two lists into one big list, using the movie titles as a guide to match up the correct information. This is like combining ingredients from two different recipes into one bowl.
4. Choosing the Important Parts:

The code focuses on specific parts of the movie information, like the movie ID, title, summary, genres, keywords, actors, and crew. It's like picking out the tastiest flavors from a mixed fruit bowl.
5. Tidying Up:

It checks for any missing information or repeats in the list and cleans those up. This is like removing any bruised or moldy pieces of fruit from the bowl.
6. Sorting Out Genres and Keywords:

It organizes the genre and keyword information into neat lists, making it easier to find specific types of movies. This is like arranging the fruit by typeâ€”apples, oranges, berries, etc.
7. Highlighting the Stars:

The code lists the top 3 actors for each movie, as well as the director's name. This is like putting the most popular fruits at the front of the bowl.
8. Breaking Down the Summary:

It splits the movie summaries into individual words, ready to be used for searching and matching. This is like cutting up the fruit into bite-sized pieces.
9. Trimming the Extra Spaces:

It removes any extra spaces from the genre, keyword, actor, and crew lists, making them more compact. This is like squeezing out any extra juice from the fruit pieces.
10. Creating a Tag List:

It combines all the important words and names from the different lists into one big "tag" list for each movie. This is like mixing all the fruit pieces together in a fruit salad.
Now the code has a well-organized list of movies with their key information and tags, ready for further tasks or analysis!
